Matlab Code to reproduce the results of the paper "A Behavioral Input-Output Parametrization of Control Policies with Suboptimality Guarantees", by Luca Furieri, Baiwei Guo, Andrea Martin and Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate. Paper available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13338
To solve the convex optimization problem, we use Mosek interfaced with Yalmip.
One can run main.m to reproduce Figure 2 in the paper.
